A Space themed mudlib that uses the LIMA Mudlib without modifying it. 

This MUD is inspired by games like Mass Effect, Elite and other multiplayer Space exploration games. 
It works on 3 layers of interaction.
# Our 3 layers
- Person (classic MUD) - you walk around, pick up things, upgrade and explore. Buy spacecrafts!
- Spacecraft - you fly ships, pick up good, sell goods, dock and navigate space to get to specific planets.
- Planet management - you extend your corporations on planets and manage the flow of goods on and off planets.

These 3 layers all interact, so you can e.g. land on a planet in your spacecraft and explore on foot.
