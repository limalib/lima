** DESIGN
**
**   Skills are represented as slash-separated names, organized as a tree
**   of skills.  Learning a skill propagates improvement up the chain to
**   the parent skills.  The total, aggregate value of a skill at any point
**   is computed from a skill and all of its parent skills.  This implies
**   that use of one skill can benefit sibling skills; for example, using a
**   sword improves the general combat skill which can help when you are
**   forced to use a polearm (which you are otherwise unskilled at).
**
**   A secondary concept of "training points" exist for each skill.  These
**   represent potential, additional improvement through formal training.
**   Similar to skill values, the training points also propagate upwards.
**   The points can then be applied to the skill and/or back down the tree;
**   for example, using a sword earns training points in combat which can
**   then be applied towards formal training with polearms or archery.
**
** MECHANICS
**
**   Progression within a skill is based on a curve (specifically, a third-
**   order polynomial).  At the low- and top-end of the skill value range,
**   it is hard to advance.  This is to represent the initial difficulty
**   of learning a new skill and the difficulty of perfecting it.  In the
**   middle of the skill value range, growth is much faster (learned points
**   are applied at a near one-to-one ratio).
**
**   At the ends of the range, skills are gained in a proportion based on
**   the LEARNING_FACTOR symbol.
**
**   As learning a skill propogates up the tree of skills, the amount
**   applied decreases exponentially (set by PROPOGATION_FACTOR).
**
**   Training points are added proportionally to the increase in the main
**   skill (set by the TRAINING_FACTOR symbol).
**
**   Learning a skill is based on three symbols: SKILL_ON_FAILURE,
**   SKILL_MIN_ON_WIN, SKILL_MAX_ON_WIN.  When a test_skill() fails, the
**   SKILL_ON_FAILURE amount is learned.  When the test_skill() succeeds,
**   then you learn something in the range of MIN/MAX based on your ratio
**   against the opposing skill (MAX if you're totally outclassed or MIN
**   if you stomp all over your opponent).
**
**   All these parameters are set in the config/skills.h file.
**
** Note: policy decision says that we aren't protecting skills from
**       "unauthorized" tampering.  This is consistent with much of
**       lib -- wizards can help players in any numbers of ways and
**       we won't try to guard against all of them.
