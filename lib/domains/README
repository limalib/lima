This directory is for mud domains.  Although domain security has been
written, there is not currently a working interface to it.  There will
be one by the alpha release.

- std   : Standard examples demonstrating features and functions of the mudlib.

- common: Your shared objects that will be used throughout all the domains.
          Consider which objects not to reinvent for each mudlib and put them here.
          These folders are provided here as an example.

- other : Name your own domains and assign Wizards to each domain using the
          admtool. Copy the file structure from common for a good start.
