About Pinto
-----------
The Pinto domain contains examples used in https://docs.limamudlib.dev/. The reader
is asked to create these examples during the learning paths provided
in the documentation, but are kept here for reference. 

If you are trying to following the learning paths, we recommend you move
/domains/pinto to /domains/pinto.bak and follow the tutorials. Learning happens
when you start creating your own code rather than just use what is provided -
even typing those examples again will help you understand the code, and noticing
and fixing those compile errors will provide valuable teachings as well.

Refer to these examples if you are stuck or things just do not work - do not just
copy them.
