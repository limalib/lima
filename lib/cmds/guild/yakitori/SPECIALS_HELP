[sweep]
  When standing it is a technique used to take an opponent to the ground by
  knocking their legs out from under them. The force of the sweep either runs
  perpendicular to the opponent's leg or  rises as it strikes the leg, lifting
  the foot from the ground. 

  REQUIREMENTS: None
  REFLEX COST: 2

[trip]
  Kuzushi Waza (or backwards trip) is a technique that consists of throwing a
  cross as if you want to reach the opponent jaw but instead you go with your
  hand to the side of his neck and then you step forward with your leg putting
  it right behind the opponent, tripping your opponent if successful. Trips
  become easier as you rank up.

  REQUIREMENTS: Combat/Special/Sweep [1]
                Dexterity 10 or higher
  REFLEX COST : 3

[roundhouse]
  This Karate technique consists of throwing a Mawashi geri (Roundhouse) to the
  midsection of the opponent as a distraction then following with a Choku-zuki
  (Jab) with the lead hand to the chin.

  REQUIREMENTS: Combat/Special/Trip [2]
                Dexterity 20 or higher
  REFLEX COST : 5 

NOTE: The damage and effectiveness improves with your skill rank in the
specials. Specials may also behave differently as your rank improves and become
more reliable.
