//  Kuzushi Waza is a Karate technique not very known in MMA and other martial
//  arts, itâ€™s primarily exclusive to Karate. Kuzushi Waza consists of throwing a
//  cross as if you want to reach the opponent jaw but instead you go with your
//  hand to the side of his neck and then you step forward with your leg putting
//  it right behind the opponent, this way, your opponent becomes trapped between
//  your arm in front and your leg behind. After that all you have to do is drive
//  through your opponent and he will automatically lose his balance and you will
//  take him down effortlessly.
