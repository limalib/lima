The entire(*) LIMA Mudlib has been formatted in VS Code by these rules:

{
    "editor.accessibilitySupport": "off",
    "[c]": {

        "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-vscode.cpptools",
        "editor.wordBasedSuggestions": false,
        "editor.suggest.insertMode": "replace",
        "editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": true,
    },
    "C_Cpp.clang_format_fallbackStyle": "{ BasedOnStyle: Microsoft, IndentWidth: 3, IncludeBlocks: Merge, IndentGotoLabels: true, KeepEmptyLinesAtTheStartOfBlocks: true}"
}

This file is normally under C:\Users\<youruser>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\ as a settings.json file
if you are using VS Code. The mudlib had been formatted by a range of different users and methods
over the years, so this change was made to make it consistent.

(*) Entire mudlib:
If you use VS Code you can use the "Format Files" extension (*) to format the entire mudlib should 
you wish to do so. Take care not to format files containing this syntax for line formatting if 
doing so:

@TEXT 
  Some text
TEXT

The entire /domains/std/school/ has not been formatted for
this exact reason as it uses this syntax extensively.
